# Noughts and crosses example
This is a simple console application which is for Noughts and crosses or with other name "tic-tac-toe". Thanks for bbyars
The core project has been cloned from https://github.com/bbyars/TicTacToe project and made some minir changes
I created a new test project and used MSTest.TestFramework for the case.
